# Shopee-I-Am-The-Best-Coder-Dataset

This is a data analysis competition to find the most suitable packaging method for each order.

The competition is corrected through kaggle. So, I donâ€™t have an answer here. But, you can still try to solve the problem.

You can see the contest info in [here](https://careers.shopee.tw/bestcoder/)
## Explanation
Each order will have a corresponding quantity and sku id in order_sku.csv. You can find the sku dimensions in sku_dimension.csv and box dimensions in box_dimension.csv. Find the appropriate box for each order.
